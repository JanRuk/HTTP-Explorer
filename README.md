# HTTP Explorer

#### This project is a simple browser application built with JavaFX. The primary goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of **client-server architecture** using Java.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The application allows users to enter a URL, and it sends an **HTTP GET request** to the specified server. The server's response is then parsed and displayed in a **WebView** component. The project focuses on:

- **HTTP Protocol**: Understanding how HTTP requests and responses work.
- **Socket Programming**: Using Java's `Socket` class to establish a connection between the client (browser) and the server.
- **Web Content Rendering**: Displaying HTML content using JavaFX's `WebView`.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **URL Parsing**: The application parses the entered URL to extract the protocol, host, port, and path.
- **HTTP GET Request**: Sends a properly formatted HTTP GET request to the server.
- **Response Handling**: Handles server responses, including status codes, headers, and content.
- **Redirection Support**: Automatically handles HTTP redirections (3xx status codes).
- **Content Rendering**: Displays HTML content in a JavaFX WebView.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This project is primarily a learning exercise to understand:

1. **Client-Server Communication**: How a client (browser) communicates with a server using HTTP.
2. **Socket Programming**: How to create and manage sockets for network communication.
3. **HTTP Protocol**: The structure of HTTP requests and responses.
4. **JavaFX**: Using JavaFX for building a simple GUI application.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the JavaFX application.
3. Enter a URL to see how the browser fetches and displays the page.
